# resultant-fvectors

Useful scripts to compute huge numbers of f-vectors of resultant polytopes as efficiently as possible, either by uniformly sampling exponent vectors or enumerating all possible exponents in a certain range.

## Background
See https://danielprofili.github.io/research.html for some background theory.
